Functionality of the Programs

Task 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations


This program takes two numerical inputs from the user and performs the following arithmetic operations:

1. Addition (add) – Adds num1 and num2.
2. Subtraction (sub) – Subtracts num2 from num1.
3. Multiplication (mult) – Multiplies num1 by num2.
4. Division (div) – Divides num1 by num2. If num2 is 0, it prevents division by zero and returns "Undefined (division by zero)".

Finally, it prints the results of all operations.


Task 2: Personalized Greeting


This program collects the user's first and last name as input and displays a welcome message using formatted string output.

The program prompts the user to enter their first name and last name.

It then prints a greeting message.
